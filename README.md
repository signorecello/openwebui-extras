# Openwebui Extras

A repo with some tools I've been coding for OpenWebUI

## OpenFire Crawler

A tool that allows your LLM to scrape or crawl pages. Uses Firecrawl, so you need to create an account there or self-host it.

## RVCKVS Youtube Transcript Fetcher

A "fork" of [this tool](https://openwebui.com/t/rvckvs/rvckvs_youtube_transcript_fetcher) that I couldn't find on github. The only change I made was a regex, so it accepts mobile links. Thanks RVCKVS, whoever you are!
